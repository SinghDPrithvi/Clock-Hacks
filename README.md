# Clock-Hacks 

This project was inspired by the millions of struggling high school who have too much work to complete and just can't get themselfs concentrated enough or focused to do the work
With this AI that we have developed as the core of predictor as to when someone is distracted, neutral or concentrated. With this we can help people the 336 million people with ADHD and other mental health issue 
or simply the general public to help themseleves focus more. Though this project isn't exactly solving these Issues it is a big step towards diagnosing it. Our AI uses machine learning algorithmn to look at 
EEG signals figure out wheter some is in a mental state of distracted, neutral or wheter they are concentrated. The eeg signals where converted into a csv file that we read and preproccesed to get it readt for training.
